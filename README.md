ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m LaToya, a computational physicist with a background in quantum physics and high-performance computing. I currently work as a [Softworld, Inc](https://softworldinc.com/) subcontractor at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/lincoln-laboratory-supercomputing-center), where I contribute to cutting-edge computational research and optimization in scientific computing.

**ðŸ”¬ My Background**
* Education: B.S. in Physics
  
* Previous Work:
   - At the Simons Foundation, I contributed to research and computational efforts in quantum physics, focusing on studying the electronic structure of [superatomic crystals](https://github.com/chelleorc/super_atomic_crystals) which won the [APS 2024 Future of Physics Top Student Presenter](https://www.brooklyn.edu/bc-brief/latoya-anderson-named-a-top-student-presenter-at-aps-march-meeting/)
   - Developing quantum chemistry workflow tools such as [ASE-PySCF](https://github.com/chelleorc/pyscf_ase_github).
  
* Research Interests: Quantum information science, machine learning, and high-performance computing.


**ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On**

* Professional Growth: Expanding my expertise in computational physics and high-performance computing.

* Community Projects:
  - [Computational Materials Science for Undergraduates](https://github.com/chelleorc/comp_mat_for_undergrads): Resource for undergraduate students interested in computational materials science that provides guidance on available tools and resources to get started.
  - [Black Physicist Publications Archive](https://github.com/chelleorc/black_physicists_proj) Highlight published and pre-published papers by Black physicists, automating data collection from arXiv and Google Scholar

* Career Goals: Transitioning into a role that allows me to leverage my computational expertise, contribute to quantum information science, and engage in science communication.


**ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Looking For**

* Opportunities: Iâ€™m interested in roles that align with my expertise in quantum chemistry, high performmance computing, and machine learning.

* Collaborations: Open to working on projects that bridge quantum many-body systems and computational science with broader applications in materials science, drug discovery, and quantum computing.

* Networking: Engaging with professionals in physics, quantum information, and computational science.
